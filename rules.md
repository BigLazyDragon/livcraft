# Rules

- Use common sense, don't be terrible
- No verbal abuse or racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. (admins can see your PMs)
- Swearing is fine but in general please refrain from sexual discussions, there are literal kids on here sometimes
- If somebody doesn't want to talk about it, don't
- Don't make us complicit in anything illegal
- No PVP unless the other player(s) agree(s)
- No griefing, use common sense in how close to others you build
- In general, additions and builds are welcome. However, it can be helpful to ask around and make sure you're not interfering with others' plans
