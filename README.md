## FAQ
- *How do I join the server?*
  - You need to be in the [LivPosting Discord](https://discord.gg/9s7TvFx) and have the Minecraft role (self-assignable in the *#pronouns* channel). Then use `livcrafting.club` to connect. The first time you join, you will be given a code to send to the livcrafting bot (DM it). Your Discord and Minecraft accounts will be linked, and you can rejoin the server.
