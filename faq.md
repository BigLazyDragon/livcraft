# FAQ

- ## I'm new on the server, what can I do?
   There is a regular **survival world** (including overworld, nether and end) and a **creative world** where you can build with unlimited resources.

   There are some bigger projects listed in the [Google doc](links.md) which you can support.

- ## How do i move around quick and easy?
   Teleport [commands](commands.md) / Nether portals and ice highways above bedrock in the nether / the overworld railways.

- ## Are there any item farms?
   Yes there are a bunch of item farms, see the [Google doc](links.md) for a list.

- ## Is *keepInventory* on?
   Yes, the gamerule *keepInventory* is switched on, if you die you will respawn with all your inventory items.

- ## Where can I build a house?
   You can pick a free place in an existing town (like spawn or commune) or build somewhere entirely else, as long as the space isn't taken. Removing default villager houses to build something fancier is fine.

- ## Can i take an item from the chests at spawn / commune?
   Yes. Just be a fair comrade and add some resources back later.
